# Installation 

The preferred way to install Cozy is via Flatpak. You can get the official package from Flathub.

Alternatively, there are third party packages available in distros' repositories. Keep in mind that these packages are usually outdated, and if you encounter an issue, they may in fact have already been fixed.

# Development
See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed instructions about developing Cozy in GNOME Builder, Fedora and Ubuntu

## FAQ
### I have imported wrong files and cannot get rid of them:
Delete the following folders to reset Cozy (this will lose all saved progress):
```
~/.local/share/cozy
~/.cache/cozy
```


### I can't uninstall the Flatpak:
Try
```console
flatpak uninstall com.github.geigi.cozy/x86_64/stable
```
or
```console
flatpak uninstall --user com.github.geigi.cozy/x86_64/stable
```
Thanks to @Meresmata

### I store my audiobooks in a location that is not accessible in the Flatpak sandbox:
You can use the [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal) application to change permissions of a Flatpak app and allow access to a custom path (e.g. `/media`) like this:
