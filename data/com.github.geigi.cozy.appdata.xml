        <p>
        This version of Cozy features an important change in library management.
        Previously every file which was imported in your library but couldn't be found anymore was removed from the library during a scan.
        Now audiobooks are not removed from your library automatically anymore. This prevents accidentally loosing the progress of a audiobook when a file can't be found temporarily.
        To remove an audiobook from the library simply right-click on it and choose the remove from library option.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The download option will be enabled for audiobooks on removable or network drives automatically for each new storage location you add.</li>
          <li>Unavailable books (books where a file can't be found) can now be opened to display the book detail view. They will be flagged with a little unavailable tag</li>
          <li>Under the hood improvements in the media importer</li>
          <li>Media playback is rewritten from ground up. It's far more stable than before.</li>
          <li>Fix: When a different system language than English is used Cozy created two folders in the users home directory on the first startup, a translated and a English one. Now only the translated folder will be created.</li>
          <li>Fix: A wrong mouse pointer was displayed with some pointer themes</li>
          <li>Fix: A memory leak in the importer</li>
          <li>Fix: The playback speed of a book was not remembered correctly</li>
          <li>Fix: The desktop integration did not respect the switch author and reader setting</li>
          <li>Many other small fixes that make Cozy more reliable</li>
          <li>As always, updated translations thanks to all of the translators!</li>
